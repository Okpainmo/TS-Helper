# Ts Helper(project in progress)
An awesome opensource project to help make typescript easier to learn, use and debug. 

It's all opensource, join in, and contribute. Simply begin by creating a Github issue of what you wish to contribute.

## Ways you can contribute

Below are some awesome ways anyone can contribute. Remember that you can contribute for any typescript-supporting library/framework you use. 

**You can contribute by:**

- Sharing comprehensive content(articles, videos, and more) in the "Learn" section of the project.

- Documenting/sharing different typescript types, with practical code samples of their use-cases. Feel free to contribute the types for any library or framework you use, including (Vanilla) Javascript.

**NOTE: You can even share content you previously published elsewhere.** - As long as you retain the right to do so.
